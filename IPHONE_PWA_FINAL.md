# iPhone PWA Installation - Final Fix

## What's Fixed Now
- Created proper PNG icons (not SVG) that Safari recognizes
- Added specific Apple PWA meta tags
- Updated manifest with correct PNG icon references
- Added Apple Touch Icon in the correct size (180x180)
- Set proper MIME types and purposes

## iPhone Installation Steps (Try Now)

1. **Force refresh** the page in Safari (pull down to refresh)
2. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up)
3. **Look for "Add to Home Screen"** - should now show a proper icon preview
4. **Tap "Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Verify the app name** shows as "Movie Masala" 
6. **Tap "Add"**

## What Changed
- PNG icons instead of SVG (Safari prefers PNG)
- Proper Apple Touch Icon dimensions (180x180)
- Enhanced PWA manifest with correct image types
- Added Safari-specific meta tags

The app should now install as a true PWA with a proper icon and run fullscreen without Safari browser bars.
