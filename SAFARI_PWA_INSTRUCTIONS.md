# Safari PWA Installation - Final Instructions

## What to Do Now

1. **Close Safari completely** (swipe up and close all Safari windows)
2. **Open Safari fresh** and navigate to your game
3. **Wait for page to fully load** with all content visible
4. **Look for install banner** - Safari may show an automatic install prompt
5. **If no banner**, tap Share button â†’ "Add to Home Screen"
6. **Check the preview** - you should see "Movie Masala" with an icon
7. **Tap "Add"**

## If Still Not Working

This may be a Safari PWA limitation. Alternative options:

1. **Use on Android** - PWA installation works reliably on Android Chrome
2. **Keep as Safari bookmark** - Still provides good mobile experience
3. **Wait for iOS update** - Apple regularly improves PWA support

## Current Status
- Minimal PWA configuration created
- Service worker registered
- Apple-specific meta tags added
- Proper 180x180 icon provided

The app functionality is identical whether installed as PWA or used in Safari.
