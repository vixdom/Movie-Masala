# Movie Masala - APK for Sideloading

## Quick Solution: PWA Installation
Your game works perfectly as a web app and can be installed natively on Android:

1. **Open the game** in Chrome on your Android device: https://your-replit-url.replit.app
2. **Tap menu** (3 dots) → "Add to Home screen" 
3. **Name it** "Movie Masala" and tap "Add"
4. **The app installs** with a proper icon and runs fullscreen like a native app

This gives you immediate native-like functionality without waiting for the APK build.

## For True APK (Alternative Methods)

### Method 1: Download and Build Locally
1. Download the `android/` folder from this Replit
2. Install Android Studio on your computer
3. Open the project and build the APK locally
4. Transfer the APK to your device

### Method 2: Wait for Build
The Gradle build will complete eventually and create:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Sideloading Steps (When APK is Ready)
1. **Settings** → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. **Settings** → Developer Options → Enable "USB Debugging" and "Install unknown apps"
3. **Transfer APK** to device and tap to install

The PWA installation method gives you the exact same gameplay experience as the APK would, just through the browser engine instead of WebView.
