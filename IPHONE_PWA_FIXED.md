# iPhone PWA Installation - Now Fixed!

## What I Fixed
- Added proper PWA manifest file
- Added Apple-specific meta tags for native app behavior
- Created Movie Masala app icons (clapboard design)
- Set display mode to "standalone" for fullscreen experience

## iPhone Installation Steps (Try Again)

1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone (must use Safari)
2. **Go to your game URL** 
3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow up)
4. **Look for "Add to Home Screen"** (should now show proper app icon)
5. **Tap "Add to Home Screen"**
6. **Name it "Movie Masala"** and tap "Add"

## What You'll Get Now
- Proper app icon with Movie Masala branding
- Runs fullscreen without Safari browser bars
- Native app switching behavior
- Appears in app drawer like any other app
- Offline functionality after first load

## The Difference
Before: Safari created a bookmark that opened in the browser
Now: Safari installs a true PWA that runs standalone

The app now has all the proper PWA configuration that iPhone Safari requires for native-like installation.
