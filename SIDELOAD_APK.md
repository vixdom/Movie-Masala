# Movie Masala - Sideload APK Guide

## Current Situation
The Gradle build system is downloading large dependency files (Gradle 8.11.1 distribution), which delays APK creation. However, I can provide you with alternative solutions for immediate testing.

## Immediate Options

### Option 1: Use the Web Version (Fastest)
Your game works perfectly in the browser and can be installed as a PWA:
1. Open the game in Chrome on your Android device
2. Tap the menu (3 dots) → "Add to Home screen"
3. The app will install like a native app with icon

### Option 2: Download Project for Local Build
Since you want an APK for sideloading, you can:
1. Download the entire `android/` folder
2. Install Android Studio on your computer
3. Open the project and build the APK locally
4. This bypasses the current dependency download issue

### Option 3: Wait for Build Completion
The Gradle build will eventually complete and create the debug APK at:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## For Sideloading (When APK is Ready)
1. **Enable Developer Options** on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   
2. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging (ON)
   - Settings → Developer Options → Install unknown apps (ON)

3. **Install the APK**:
   - Transfer app-debug.apk to your device
   - Open file manager, tap the APK file
   - Follow installation prompts

## Current Status
- Web build: ✅ Complete and working
- Android project: ✅ Synced with latest code
- APK build: ⏳ Waiting for Gradle dependencies

The PWA option gives you immediate native-like functionality while we wait for the APK build to complete.
